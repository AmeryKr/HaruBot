## Permissions
When you invite HaruBot to your server, you should set up the role permissions.

To set them up, you should use the `level` command, followed by the level for the role (can be either -1, 1, 2, or 3), and then followed by the role name or a role mention.

**For example**: Server with prefix set to `?`, and a role called "Dev" that needs level 3 permissions.
