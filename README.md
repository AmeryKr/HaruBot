A small Discord bot, mostly made with ♥. Due to time constraints, I had to discontinue this project. Sorry, Haru ;-;

#### Currently powered by:
+ Node.js (Minimum v5.10.1)
+ Discordie (Much ♥ to qeled)
+ Nedb (Much ♥ to louischariot)
+ Water gun (Thanks Haru!)

## Permissions
When you invite HaruBot to your server, you should set up the role permissions.

To set them up, you should use the `level` command, followed by the level for the role (can be either -1, 1, 2, or 3), and then followed by the role name or a role mention.
